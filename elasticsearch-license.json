1.2 Reservation of Rights; Restrictions. As between Elastic and You, Elastic owns all right title and interest in and to the Software and any derivative works thereof, and except as expressly set forth in Section 1.1 above, no other license to the Software is granted to You by implication, estoppel or otherwise.  You agree not to: (i) reverse engineer or decompile, decrypt, disassemble or otherwise reduce any Software or any portion thereof to human-readable form, except and only to the extent any such restriction is prohibited by applicable law, (ii) deploy the Software on more Nodes than are permitted under the applicable License grant in Section 1.1 above, (iii) where You have purchased a Subscription, use the Software in connection with any Project other than the Project for which You have purchased such Subscription, as identified on the applicable Order Form, (iv) prepare derivative works from, modify, copy or use the Software in any manner except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; (v) except as expressly permitted in Section 1.1 above, transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense, loan or otherwise transfer the Software in whole or in part to any third party; (vi) except as may be expressly permitted on an applicable Order Form or in another agreement between the parties, use the Software for providing time-sharing services, any software-as-a-service offering (“SaaS”), service bureau services or as part of an application services provider or other service offering; (vii) circumvent the limitations on use of the Software that are imposed or preserved by any License Key, (viii) alter or remove any Marks and Notices in the Software; (ix) deploy the Commercial Software on or in connection with any third party infrastructure as a service that includes any Elastic-branded software as a service; or (x) make available to any third party any analysis of the results of operation of the Software, including benchmarking results, without the prior written consent of Elastic.  The Software may contain or be provided with open source libraries, components, utilities and other open source software (collectively, “Open Source Software”), which Open Source Software may have applicable license terms as identified on a website designated by Elastic or otherwise provided with the Software or Documentation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, use of the Open Source Software shall be subject to the license terms and conditions applicable to such Open Source Software, to the extent required by the applicable licensor (which terms shall not restrict the license rights granted to You hereunder, but may contain additional rights).

1.3 Audit Rights.

You agree to provide Elastic with the necessary access to the Software to conduct such an audit either (i) remotely, or (ii) if remote performance is not possible, at Your facilities, during normal business hours and no more than one (1) time in any twelve (12) month period.   In the event any such audit reveals that You have used the Software in excess of the applicable quantitative limitations, You agree to promptly pay to Elastic an amount equal to the difference between the fees actually paid and the fees that You should have paid to remain in compliance with such quantitative limitations.  This Section 1.3 shall survive for a period of two (2) years from the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall automatically terminate in the event that You intentionally breach the scope of a license granted in Section 1.1 of this Agreement, provided that Elastic reserves the right to retroactively waive such automatic termination upon written notice to You.

2.3 Post Termination or Expiration.  Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, for any reason, You shall promptly cease the use of the Software and Documentation and destroy (and certify to Elastic in writing the fact of such destruction), or return to Elastic, all copies of the Software and Documentation then in Your possession or under Your control.

2.4 Survival.  Sections 2.3, 2.4, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (as any such Sections may be modified by Attachment 1, if applicable) shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

3. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

3.1 Limited Performance Warranty.

In the event of a breach of the foregoing warranty, Elastic’s sole obligation, and Your exclusive remedy shall be for Elastic to (i) correct any failure(s) of the Software to perform in all material respects in accordance with the Documentation or (ii) if Elastic is unable to provide such a correction within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the applicable non-conformity, You may elect to terminate this Agreement and the associated Subscription, and Elastic will promptly refund to You any pre-paid, unused fees paid by You to Elastic for the applicable Subscription.  The warranty set forth in this Section 3.1 does not apply if the applicable Software or any portion thereof: (a) has been altered, except by or on behalf Elastic; (b) has not been used, installed, operated, repaired, or maintained in accordance with this Agreement and/or the Documentation; (c) has been subjected to abnormal physical or electrical stress, misuse, negligence, or accident; or (d) is used on equipment, products, or systems not meeting specifications identified by Elastic in the Documentation.  Additionally, the warranties set forth herein only apply when notice of a warranty claim is provided to Elastic within the applicable warranty period specified herein and do not apply to any bug, defect or error caused by or attributable to software or hardware not supplied by Elastic.

3.2 Malicious Code.  Elastic represents and warrants that prior to making it available for delivery to You, Elastic will use standard industry practices including, without limitation, the use of an updated commercial anti-virus program, to test the Software for Malicious Code and remove any Malicious Code it discovers.  In the event of a breach of the foregoing warranty, Elastic’s sole obligation, and Your exclusive remedy shall be for Elastic to replace the Software with Software that does not contain any Malicious Code.

3.3 Warranty Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 3, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND ELASTIC AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY REGARDING OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION.

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

The provisions of this Section 4, including to the extent modified by an applicable provision in Attachment 1 hereto, apply if You have not purchased a Subscription.  If you have purchased a Subscription, then the limitations of liability set forth in the applicable Subscription Agreement will apply in lieu of those set forth in this Section 4, including to the extent modified by an applicable provision in Attachment 1 hereto.

4.1 Disclaimer of Certain Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL YOU OR ELASTIC OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF OR FAILURE TO PERFORM THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER ALLEGED AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORTIOUS CONDUCT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
